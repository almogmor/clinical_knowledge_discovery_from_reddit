      <text>COMMENT-EVAL_102@I haven't gone through what you have but My husband currently has NHL and it sucks, to say the least. For him mainly, but also for me and the kids. My biggest fear right now is that I get cancer at the same time as him. Who will take care of him, who will take care of me, who will take care of the kids? Cancer is a sick fucking joke. </text>

      <text>I am really sorry to hear your family has to go through this. I hope that you have a good support system. Being the caregiver is very hard in it's own way. I feel like you'll have such great empathy for him and that will help you help him get through it. At times I do forget to think about how it must feel for my husband to go through this and I try to remember to be sympathetic and empathetic. </text>
