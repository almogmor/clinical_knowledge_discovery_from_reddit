      <text>COMMENT-EVAL_10@You sound like an incredible husband and this is completely unfair to you, your wife and your daughter. I’m so sorry, my heart is broken for you all. I wish I could help more but all I can offer is my advice to try to live for each moment you have with her. Hold her hand and tell her you love her, make her as comfortable as possible. Cry and laugh with her. This cancer is cruel and its victims don’t deserve the pain and heartbreak it causes. The only thing I’m thankful for in my dad’s passing is that we had so much closure and could say our goodbyes, whereas so many people leave this world suddenly. Sometimes all I have to hold on to when I get sad is remembering that the last thing my dad said to me was that he loved me. He didn’t deserve this and neither does your wife. I’m so very sorry.</text>
