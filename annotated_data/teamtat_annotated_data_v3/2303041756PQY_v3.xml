      <text>COMMENT-EVAL_128@When the time came, I just went for a messy sort of pixie cut. It was a big change but I knew I wouldnâ€™t be able to cope with my mid-length hair falling out everywhere and I had enough length to make a good donation to wigs for kids. It was crazy to watch the stylist chop off my pigtails but also kind of freeing, I have to admit. </text>

      <text>I ended up really liking it! It was a much-needed change I guess, though it only lasted for a couple weeks or so before things got real.</text>

      <text>I hope I can go back to rocking that style again once this is all through! The hair loss is a scary and uncomfortable prospect to face, but I do try to look at it as a temporary state and in the meantime jazz up the look a bit with different caps and accessories.</text>
