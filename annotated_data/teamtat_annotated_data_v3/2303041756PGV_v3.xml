      <text>COMMENT-EVAL_139@Hi Iâ€™m extremely interested in this but I would love to fly over at the last minute because I already have a passport and money about two thousand but if I could work at least one more week I could have another thousand. Do you provide a plane ticket and a place to stay during this festival also I went to the university of Kentucky but do not have a degree but consider myself very self educated on this subject</text>
